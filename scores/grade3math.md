Understanding Scores

# Grade Three Mathematics

## What are the knowledge and skills the student is expected to learn in grade three mathematics?

In grade three, students continue to build their concept of numbers, including developing an understanding of fractions as numbers. They learn the concepts behind multiplication and division and apply problem-solving skills and strategies for multiplying and dividing numbers up through 100 to solve word problems. Students also make connections between the concept of the area of a rectangle and multiplication and addition of whole numbers.

## Overall Achievement

The student took a Smarter Balanced assessment based on the grade three [Idaho Content Standards](http://sde.idaho.gov/academic/standards/) for mathematics and received an overall score that ranges from about 2000 to 3000. This overall score falls into one of the four achievement levels shown here. Sample test items may be included that exemplify the kinds of passages and questions that students at different levels of achievement would likely answer correctly.

## Student Achievement by Claim

The student’s results are also reported out into the three claims (i.e., areas) that together make up mathematics: Concepts and Procedures, Problem Solving and Modeling/Data Analysis, and Communicating Reasoning. These three claims (i.e., areas) are based on [Idaho Content Standards](http://sde.idaho.gov/academic/standards/), which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in grade three.

If the student received a score of “No Score Available” for any claim, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive a score in that area.

To view a description of the student’s achievement level claim (i.e., area), select either **Above Standard**, **Near Standard**, or **Below Standard** from the student-level selections available in the table below.
