Understanding Scores

# Grade Seven Mathematics

## What are the knowledge and skills the student is expected to learn in grade seven mathematics?

In grade seven, students further develop their understanding of rates and ratios, statistics and probability, using tables, graphs, and equations to solve real-world problems involving proportional relationships. Students also work on quickly and accurately solving multistep problems involving positive and negative rational numbers—any number that can be made by dividing one integer by another, such as 1/2, –0.75, or 2. Additionally, students expand their knowledge of geometry and apply the properties of operations to solve real-world problems involving the measurement of multidimensional objects.

## Overall Achievement

The student took a Smarter Balanced assessment based on the grade seven [Oregon academic content standards](http://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/standards/Pages/default.aspx) for mathematics and received an overall score.
This overall score falls into one of the four achievement levels shown here. Sample test items may be included that exemplify the kinds of passages and questions that students at
different levels of achievement would likely answer correctly.

## Student Achievement by Claim

The student’s results are also reported out into the three claims (i.e., areas) that together make up mathematics: Concepts and Procedures, Problem Solving and Modeling/Data Analysis, and Communicating Reasoning. These three claims are based on [Oregon's academic content standards](http://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/standards/Pages/default.aspx), which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in grade seven.

If the student did not receive a score for any claim, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive claim scores.

To view a description of the student’s achievement level claim (i.e., area), select either **Above Standard**, **Near Standard**, or **Below Standard** from the student-level selections available in the table below.
