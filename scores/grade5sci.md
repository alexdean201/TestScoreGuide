## Student Achievement by Claim

The student’s results are also reported out into the three claims (i.e., areas) that together make up mathematics: Concepts and Procedures,
Problem Solving and Modeling/Data Analysis, and Communicating Reasoning. These three claims (i.e., areas) are based on [California’s academic standards](http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/index.asp), which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in grade five.

If the student received a score of “No Score Available” for any claim, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive a score in that area.

To view a description of the student’s achievement level claim (i.e., area), select either **Above Standard**, **Near Standard**, or **Below Standard** from the student-level selections available in the table below.

<div class="by-claim concepts">
	<div class="claim">
		<h3>Concepts and Procedures</h3>
		<p>The Concepts and Procedures claim (i.e., area) assesses the student’s understanding of key mathematical concepts and procedures and the student’s ability to apply these concepts and procedures to solve problems.</p>

			<li>state logical assumptions being used;</li>
			<li>use the technique of breaking an argument into cases;</li>
			<li>distinguish correct logic or reasoning from that which is flawed, and—if there is a flaw in the argument—explain what it is; and</li>
			<li>base arguments on concrete referents such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and actions.</li>
